# Simple-Quiz-App

This is a simple quiz app that was developed using HTML, CSS, Javascript. In order to run this application, please create a folder. Inside the folder, create three new files. The names of the files should be "index.html", "style.css", and "app.js". Then copy and paste the code in the respective files. If using VS Code, you can simply use live server to run the web application. If you are running the application from the command line, please navigate to where the project is stored and simply type "open index.html". 

Once you answer the question, click the submit button. At the end it will show how many questions you answered correctly. I will be attaching screenshot of me going through the quiz so the user can get a feel for how the game works.

<p> Here is the screenshot of the application running and what the game looks like </p>
